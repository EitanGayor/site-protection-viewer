# site-protection-viewer
This tool will provide the user with a simple way to see the current security configuration of the websites protected by our Cloud WAF (Incapsula). It provides a centralized view of all the account website security configuration and also checks whether the sites origin servers can be accessed directly (and not only via Incapsula).
